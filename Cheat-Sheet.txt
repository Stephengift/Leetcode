HashMap:

putIfAbsent(key, value) - will populate the key with the value associated with it, if the key doesnt exit. Otherwise, key stays the same.

getOrDefault(key, value) - method returns the value of the entry in the map which has a specified key. If the entry does not exist then the value is returned.


String:

indexOf("value") - will return the index of the value in the String
indexOf("value", i) - will return the index of the value in the string =, but starting from index i
substring(i, j) - will return the string starting at index i(inclusive) and ending at index j(exclusive)

Monotionic stack - a stack that mantains an increasing or decreasing presence
----Pseudocode--
Given an integer array nums
stack = []
for num in nums:
    while stack.length > 0 AND stack.top >= num:
        stack.pop()
    // Between the above and below lines, do some logic depending on the problem
    stack.push(num)

    //correct calculation of the middle index/integer of an array in java
    left + (right - left) / 2
